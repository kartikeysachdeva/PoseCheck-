Inspiration

With everyone stuck at home due to the COVID pandemic, at-home-workouts have been more popular than ever. However, for many of us jumping into the world of fitness for the first time, exercising with proper form is challenging. Yet, without any coach or workout buddies, it's hard to identify where we need to improve. SuperPose is a software solution that highlights areas of improvement in your technique to optimize your movements.

Implementation
SuperPose was developed using React for the front-end UI and TensorFlow.js to handle image processing.

Local Usage
Go the the SuperPose/client folder: cd SuperPose/client
